# Developers

If you want to contribute or are interested in building something with Bookworms here is how to get started.

## Importing Bookworms modules

Add Bookworms into your project.

```Bash
$ npm i bookworms
```

Bookworms has all of its modules available to be imported into another project if you are interested in building on top of it. You should note that it uses [ECMAScript modules](https://nodejs.org/api/vm.html#vm_class_vm_module) which were introduced in Node 14, to take advantage of these you might want to consider the following.

Include a `.nvmrc` to use a version of node that supports [ECMAScript modules](https://nodejs.org/api/vm.html#vm_class_vm_module).

```BASH
# .nvmrc
# Used to run the correct node version
14
```

Add into your `.package.json`:

```JSON
"type": "module"
```

You can now import Bookworms into your project.

```JS
import {loadBookmarks, generateBookmarks, saveBookmarks, mergeBookmarks} from 'bookworms';
```

These give you access to different functions used to generate Bookmarks.

#### `loadBookmarks`

A collection of helpers for loading bookmarks.

- `fetchBookmarkConfig(path, asYAML)` - load local or remote bookmarks from path, asYAML is a boolean, default is false and returns JSON
- `shouldFetchFromLocal(path)` - undersstand if a path is local or remote
- `fetchLocaleBookmarkYAML(path)` - load bookmarks from `fs`
- `fetchRemoteBoomarkYAML(path)` - load bookmarks from `http` request
- `returnResponseOn2xx(body, statusCode, path)` - handle non 2xx `http` responses
- `returnResponseAsObject(response, path)` - return javascript object, converting YAML or JSON

#### `generateBookmarks`

A collection of helpers for generating bookmarks.

- `createBookmarks(path, directory)` - load bookmarks from path, generate bookmarks are store in a directory
- `generateImportBookmarkMarkup(config)` - from loaded bookmark config create the different types of exports wanted
- `traverseStructure({ bookmarks, folders }, type)` - traverse the strutcure of the bookmarks
- `traverseFolders(folders, type)` - traverse the folders within the bookmarks
- `traverseBookmarks(bookmarks, type)` - traverse the individual bookmarks within the bookmark config
- `generateBookmarkFolderMarkup(index, label, description, children, type)` - pass values into template and get back string of folder markup
- `generateBookmarkLinkMarkup(bookmark, type)` - pass values into template and get back string of bookmark markup
- `generateTimeStamp()` - generate timestamp for when Bookworms was run

#### `saveBookmarks`

A collection of helpers for saving bookmarks.

- `writeBookmarks(directory, bookmarks)` - Writing the bookmark populated templates to `fs`
- `trimTrailingSlash(directory)` - remove trailing slashes from string

#### `mergeBookmarks`

A collection of helpers for merging and generating bookmarks.

- `createBookmarks(bookmarkPaths, directory, label, descriptions)` - load mutliple bookmarks from paths, merge into new config allowing custom label and description, generate bookmarks are store in a directory
- `mergedBookmark(bookmarkPaths, label, descriptions)` - load mutliple bookmarks from paths, merge into new config allowing custom label and description

#### `convertBookmarks`

A collection of helpers for converting browsers `HTML` export of bookmarks into `YAML`.

- `parseHTMLtoJSON(path)` - browsers `HTML` export of bookmarks into JSON, this data is not normalised for Bookworms
- `generateBookwormJSON(json)` - takes the `JSON` from `parseHTMLtoJSON` and normalises it into a format Bookworms understands
- `traverseStructure(json)` - traverses `parseHTMLtoJSON` JSON to return a deep `JSON` structure for `generateBookwormJSON`
- `convertHTMLtoYAML(path)` - Pass `HTML` to this function and it will return `YAML` that matches Bookmarks schema
- `createBookmarks(path, directory, filename)` - Generate `YAML` from browsers `HTML` export of bookmarks and store to disk based on option

#### `checkBoomkarks`

A collection of helpers for checking whether the output files are up to date with the yaml file.

- `checkBookmarks(path, directory)` - load bookmarks from `path`, and check whether the files generated from it are equivalent to the output files residing in `directory`
- `sanitizeDynamicData(bookmarkBody)` - sanitizes dynamic data from the bookmark body, to be clean of data which is generated dynamically unrelated to the yaml. Currently, the dynamic data in the output is creation dates.
- `checkBookmarkBody(existingBookmarkBody, generatedBookmarkBody)` - returns whether 2 output bookmarks files are equivalent (equal except dynamic data).
- `checkSingleBookmark(generatedBookmark, directory)` - checks whether a bookmark object (with a `filename` and `body`) is equivalent to the output bookmark file with the same name in `directory`.

## Contributing to Bookworms

If you want to add features to Bookworms you will need to know how to work with the project.

```BASH
$ git clone https://github.com/thearegee/bookworms.git
$ cd bookworms
$ nvm use
$ npm i
```

### Running the executable script

Within the `./bin` folder you have a script you can execute, which can be done in a couple of ways:

```BASH
# Directly from node
$ node --experimental-vm-modules ./bin/index.js
# npm
$ npm start
```

All of these will return the following:

```BASH
index.js [command]

Commands:
  index.js get <bookmarks>      Local path or remote URL
  index.js merge <bookmarks..>  Array of paths or URLs you want to merge

Options:
      --version    Show version number                                 [boolean]
  -d, --directory  The directory where the files are generated
                                                        [string] [default: "./"]
      --help       Show help                                           [boolean]
      --bookmarks                                                     [required]

Missing required argument: bookmarks
You need to supply the location of your bookmarks
```

You can see that there was no bookmarks passed, these are two examples you could use:

```BASH
# Remote config
$ npm start -- get https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thearegee/bookworms/main/demo/config/bookmarks.yaml
# Locale config
$ npm start -- get ./demo/config/bookmarks.yaml
```

by default this will export the files into `./` but if you want to change this you can with the flag `-d` or `--directory`.

```BASH
# Locale config
$ npm start -- get ./demo/config/bookmarks.yaml -d="./demo"
```

If you are merging bookmarks you have some additional options:

```Bash
index.js merge <bookmarks..>

Array of paths or URLs you want to merge

Options:
      --version    Show version number                                 [boolean]
  -d, --directory  The directory where the files are generated
                                                        [string] [default: "./"]
      --help       Show help                                           [boolean]
  -t, --text       Description of your top level bookmarks folder       [string]
  -l, --label      Top level folder name for merged bookmarks           [string]
      --bookmarks                                                     [required]
```

### Testing

Bookworms uses [`Jest`](https://jestjs.io/) for unit tests and will dogfood itself to ensure the remote and local YMAL generate the correct exports.

```BASH
# Single run
$ npm test
# Watched files that change
$ npm run test:watch
```
